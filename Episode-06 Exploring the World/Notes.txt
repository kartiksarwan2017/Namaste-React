Q Why do we need state variables? 
Whenever state variable will be changed react will re render the component and all the updated values will be there.
Whenever state variables update, React triggers a reconciliation cycle (re-renders the component).

Virtual DOM is the object representation of the JSX.

Whenever the state variable changes, react find the difference between the Newer Virtual DOM and Older Virtual DOM. 
and sees input is getting changed so its re renders the component but updates the value in the DOM.

React Fiber => optimizing the DOM.
